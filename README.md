Excel-based data analytics case study on CPI data (rural, urban, and combined). Performed data cleaning, trend analysis, sector-wise comparisons, and insights using formulas, pivot tables, charts, date &amp; text functions. Answered analytical business questions and documented findings clearly.
This project focuses on exploratory and analytical study of Consumer Price Index (CPI) data across rural, urban, and combined sectors. The dataset was processed entirely in Microsoft Excel with an emphasis on structured data analysis and insight generation.

Key tasks included data cleaning, normalization, handling missing or inconsistent values, and organizing data for analysis. Advanced Excel functions, pivot tables, conditional formulas, and date-based calculations were used to analyze inflation trends, category-wise price movements, and temporal variations. Multiple charts and pivot dashboards were created to support trend analysis and comparative insights.
